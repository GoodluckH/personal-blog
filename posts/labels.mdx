# Label is bad

We often attach labels to other people, which is bad because it generalizes away any individuality, it secludes us from meaningful human interactions. But we also label ourselves, which secludes us from learning.

"I'm a lawyer, I'm not gonna try to crunch those numbers on Excel", said a general councel in the Teams call. I think this mindset is incredibly dangerous, especially in an age where we let our job titles define who we are.

# Common sense

truth can be counterintuitive. That means we cannot follow common senses that much. If we think in terms of common sense, then we will become commoners. Nothign bad about it, but if you crave success, commoner perhaps is not where you wnat to end up at.

if you chase money, you won't get any.
if you chase sex, you won;t get any.

    maybe you will, but the journey will be much more difficult. We often see examples where people who don't care about somethign ended up getting the most of that something.

    Someone who'se obsessed with playing minecraft with no interst in women ended up having the most sex.
    some nerds who just want to solve a problem ended up create a multi-billion dollar company.
